## This is a Heading 2
Here I am testing also basic **Markdown** *sintax*

Steps to create a blog post:
- Create a new .md file
- Copy the top part from another file
- Update post properties
- Write text
- Add media like this: `![Reasonably lengthy description of the image](/images/good-descriptive-file-name.jpg)`
- Save your media to the 'public' folder, for example: public/images or public/animations.
- The heroImage at the frontmatter will show up on shared links like WhatsApp better stay under 500 KB.
- Commit, the upload to Netlify should be automatic
